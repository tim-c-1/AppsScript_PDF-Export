# AppsScript_PDF-Export
Collection of my Google Sheets Apps scripts.

The createCopy script creates a copy of the active spreadsheet and save it in the specified folder. This is intended to use when working with a template sheet that you need to create a separate copy when working on a new project with the template. It takes user input to create the file name.

The exportPDF script creates a PDF file of the active sheet and saves it to the specified folder. This could easily be adjusted to export as any of the Google Drive supported file types. Useful if you are consistently exporting files for reporting, for example.
